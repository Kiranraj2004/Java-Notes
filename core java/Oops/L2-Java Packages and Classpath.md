#### **1. What is a Package?**

- A **package** in Java is essentially a folder or directory used to organize classes.
    
- Just as we organize files in folders on our computers, we organize Java classes in packages.
    
- A **package** helps avoid naming conflicts (e.g., having multiple classes named `Cat`).
    

#### **2. Why Use Packages?**

- Packages help avoid class name conflicts. For example:
    
    - You can have a class `Cat` in package `test` and another class `Cat` in package `test2`.
        
    - The JVM will differentiate between the two based on the package they belong to.
        

#### **3. How to Create and Use a Package**

- The package declaration is the first line in a Java class:
    
    ```java
    package test;
    ```
    
- If a class is in a package called `test`, it will be identified by its package name and class name, e.g., `test.Cat`.
    

#### **4. Importing Classes from Other Packages**

- To use classes from another package, **import** them:
    
    ```java
    import test2.Cat;
    ```
    
- Once imported, you can instantiate classes as needed:
    
    ```java
    Cat myCat = new Cat();  // From test2 package
    ```
    

#### **5. Package Naming Convention**

- Java follows a **naming convention** for packages:
    
    - Typically, the package name is written in **lowercase** and follows a domain name structure in reverse.
        
    - Example: `com.companyname.projectname`
        
- For example:
    
    ```java
    package com.engineeringdigest.corejava.animals;
    ```
    

#### **6. Classpath and Package Structure**

- **Classpath** is the directory path that the JVM uses to locate classes and packages.
    
- When running a Java program, you specify the classpath using:
    
    ```bash
    java -cp <path> <class name>
    ```
    
- If the class is within a package, you specify the full path:
    
    ```bash
    java com.engineeringdigest.corejava.test.TestClass
    ```
    
- This tells the JVM where to search for the `TestClass`.
    

#### **7. Access Modifiers and Visibility**

- A class can be `public` or have **package-private** (default) visibility.
    
- **Public classes** must be named the same as the `.java` file.
    
- Classes that are not `public` (package-private) are visible only within their package.
    

#### **8. Multiple Classes in a Single File**

- Java allows multiple classes in the same `.java` file.
    
- The **public class** must be the same name as the file.
    
- Other classes in the file are **package-private** and accessible only within the same package.
    

#### **9. Inner Classes (Nested Classes)**

- A **nested class** (or inner class) is defined within another class.
    
- You can create an instance of a nested class only after instantiating the enclosing class.
    
    ```java
    OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
    OuterClass.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass();
    ```
    

#### **10. Practical Example**

- Let’s assume we have a project named `corejava` with packages like `animals` and `vehicles`. Inside `vehicles`, we can have a `Car` class and a `Cycle` class.
    
- The `Cycle` class can be **public** or **package-private**. If it is package-private, it will not be accessible outside its package unless explicitly imported.
    

#### **11. Common Errors**

- **Package Structure and File Name**: If you define a public class, its name must match the file name:
    
    - If the class is named `Car`, the file must be named `Car.java`.
        
    - Otherwise, you will get a compilation error.
        
- **Classpath Error**: When running a program, ensure the classpath is set correctly. If not, the JVM will fail to find the class, resulting in an error like `ClassNotFoundException`.
