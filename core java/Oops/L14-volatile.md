### 🧠 **Java Concurrency Notes – `volatile`, Caching, and Atomicity**

---

#### ✅ **What is `volatile` in Java?**

- The `volatile` keyword ensures **visibility** of changes to variables across threads.
    
- When a variable is declared `volatile`, it tells the JVM:
    
    - Do **not cache** this variable locally in a thread.
        
    - Always **read/write directly** from **main memory**.
        
- Used to **communicate state changes** (e.g., a flag becoming `true`).

#### ⚠️ **Why normal variables can fail in multithreading?**

- Threads have their **own cache** of variables.
    
- One thread updating a variable may not reflect in another thread’s cache.
    
- Leads to **stale reads**—a reader thread may not see the latest value.
    
- Example:
    
    - A `flag` is set to `true` in writer thread.
        
    - Reader thread keeps checking it in a loop but never sees the change → because it reads from cache, not main memory.

#### 💡 **How `volatile` fixes it?**

- Declaring `flag` as `volatile` ensures:
    
    - Reader thread reads it **from main memory**.
        
    - As soon as the writer updates the flag, reader thread sees the updated value.

#### 🚫 **Limitations of `volatile`**

- It **only ensures visibility**, **not atomicity**.
    
- Doesn't prevent **race conditions** when multiple threads update a variable.
    
- Example: Incrementing a counter:
    
    ```java
    counter++;
    ```
    
    - This is **not atomic** (read-modify-write happens in steps).
        
    - Multiple threads can corrupt the value even if `counter` is `volatile`.

#### ✅ **Atomicity with `AtomicInteger`**

- Use `AtomicInteger` for thread-safe increments without using `synchronized` or `locks`.
    

##### Example:

```java
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

counter.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic increment
int value = counter.get(); // Atomic read
```

- Comes from `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package.
    
- Other atomic types:
    
    - `AtomicLong`, `AtomicBoolean`, `AtomicReference`, etc.

#### 🔑 **When to Use What?**

|Use Case|Best Approach|
|---|---|
|State flag shared between threads|`volatile`|
|Simple increment/decrement counters|`AtomicInteger`|
|Complex read/write operations|`synchronized` or `locks`|
