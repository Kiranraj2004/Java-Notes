### üîπ **Definition**

- Polymorphism is one of the four core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), along with:
    
    - Encapsulation
        
    - Inheritance
        
    - Abstraction
        
- The term **"Polymorphism"** means **"many forms"** (`poly` = many, `morph` = form).
    
- It allows a method to perform **different tasks** based on the object it is acting upon, **even if the method name and signature are the same**.
    

---

## üü¢ **Types of Polymorphism**

### 1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Binding)**

- Achieved through **Method Overloading**.
    
- The method to be called is decided **at compile time** based on:
    
    - Number of parameters
        
    - Type of parameters
        

#### ‚û§ **Example**:

```java
class Calculator {
    void add(int a, int b) { }
    void add(int a, int b, int c) { }
    void add(double a, double b) { }
}
```

- All methods are named `add`, but have **different parameter lists**.
    
- This is method overloading, and the correct method is resolved **during compilation**.
    

---

### 2. **Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)**

- Achieved through **Method Overriding**.
    
- Decision about which method to execute is made **at runtime**.
    

#### ‚û§ **Example**:

```java
class Animal {
    void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("woof");
    }
    void sayBye() {
        System.out.println("bye");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("meow");
    }
}
```

#### ‚û§ **Code Usage**:

```java
Animal a1 = new Dog();
Animal a2 = new Cat();

a1.sayHello();  // Output: woof
a2.sayHello();  // Output: meow
```

- Although the reference is of type `Animal`, the method of the **actual object** (`Dog` or `Cat`) is called.
    
- This behavior is known as **Dynamic Method Dispatch**.
    

---

## üî∏ **Dynamic Method Dispatch**

- At runtime, the JVM determines the actual object type and **calls the overridden method**.
    
- This mechanism enables **runtime polymorphism**.
    
- Called **"Dynamic Method Dispatch"** because the decision of which method to call is made **dynamically (at runtime)**.
    

---

## üî∏ **Upcasting and Downcasting**

### ‚úÖ **Upcasting**

- Refers to assigning the child class object to the parent class reference.
    

```java
Animal a = new Dog(); // Valid (upcasting)
```

- We can only call methods **declared in the parent class** using the parent reference.
    

### ‚ùå **Downcasting**

- Trying to assign the parent class reference to a child class reference directly is not allowed:
    


```java
Dog d = new Animal(); // ‚ùå Invalid
```

Let‚Äôs explore **why** this is not allowed in Java.

---

## üî∑ What‚Äôs Happening Here?

You're trying to assign a **parent class object (`Animal`)** to a **child class reference (`Dog`)**.

This is called **downcasting** (from parent to child), but you're trying to do it **without an explicit cast**, and **even with a cast, it still wouldn't work unless the object is actually a Dog.**

---

### üî∂ Why This Is Invalid

### ‚ùó Reason:

> A **parent class object** (`Animal`) **does not necessarily have the features of the child class** (`Dog`), so the compiler prevents this assignment **to ensure type safety**.

---

### üîç Analogy

Imagine:

- `Animal` is a **generic animal**.
    
- `Dog` is a **specific kind of animal** with extra behavior.
    

Would it make sense to treat a **generic animal** as if it were **definitely a dog**? ‚ùå No ‚Äî because **not all animals are dogs**, and **`Animal` lacks `Dog`-specific features.**

---

### üîß Code Breakdown

#### ‚úÖ Valid (Upcasting ‚Äî always safe):

```java
Dog d = new Dog();       // Fine: Dog to Dog
Animal a = new Dog();    // Fine: Dog ‚Üí Animal (upcasting)
```

#### ‚ùå Invalid (Wrong Downcasting ‚Äî not safe):

```java
Dog d = new Animal();    // ‚ùå Compile-time Error
```

#### ‚úÖ Explicit Downcasting (only safe if the object is truly a Dog):

```java
Animal a = new Dog();    // Upcasting (OK)
Dog d = (Dog) a;         // Downcasting (OK ‚Äî because object is Dog)
```

#### ‚ùå Runtime Error (invalid cast):

```java
Animal a = new Animal();  // Just a generic Animal
Dog d = (Dog) a;          // ‚úÖ Compiles, ‚ùå Runtime: ClassCastException
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Output of invalid downcast:

```java
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException: class Animal cannot be cast to class Dog
```

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

|Code|Compiles?|Runs?|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|`Animal a = new Dog();`|‚úÖ|‚úÖ|Upcasting ‚Äî safe|
|`Dog d = new Animal();`|‚ùå|-|‚ùå Compile-time error|
|`Dog d = (Dog) new Animal();`|‚úÖ|‚ùå|‚ùå ClassCastException|
|`Dog d = (Dog) new Dog();`|‚úÖ|‚úÖ|‚úÖ Safe downcast|

---

## üß† Conclusion

- **You cannot directly assign a parent object to a child reference** (`Dog d = new Animal();`) because:
    
    - Not all Animals are Dogs.
        
    - It‚Äôs not type-safe.
        
    - Child references expect all methods/fields of the child class, which the parent object doesn‚Äôt have.




    

```java
Animal a = new Dog();
Dog d = (Dog) a; // Valid, because 'a' refers to a Dog object
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Access Limitation via Upcasting**

- When using a parent class reference (like `Animal a = new Dog()`), you **cannot access child-specific methods** (like `sayBye()` in Dog) unless **downcasting** is performed.
    

## üî∑ Concept Recap: Parent Reference ‚Üí Child Object

```java
Animal a = new Dog();
```

This is known as **upcasting** ‚Äì a `Dog` object is being referred to using an `Animal` reference.

---

## üî∂ Why You Can‚Äôt Access Child-Specific Methods (Without Downcasting)

### üîπ Java uses the **type of the reference** (not the object) to determine which methods are **accessible at compile-time**.

- The compiler only looks at what **methods exist in the `Animal` class** (i.e., the reference type), **not in the actual object (`Dog`)**.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Example Code:

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    void sayBye() {
        System.out.println("Dog says bye!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();  // Upcasting: Dog object ‚Üí Animal reference

        a.makeSound();         // ‚úÖ Allowed (method exists in Animal, overridden in Dog)

        // a.sayBye();         ‚ùå Compilation Error: sayBye() not in Animal

        // Downcasting to access Dog-specific method
        Dog d = (Dog) a;
        d.sayBye();            // ‚úÖ Allowed after downcasting
    }
}
```

---

### üîç Output:

```
Dog barks
Dog says bye!
```

---

## ‚ùó Why This Happens?

### üìå Key Point:

> **Java is statically typed** ‚Äî the compiler checks method access based on the **reference type**, not the actual object type.

Even though `a` actually points to a `Dog` object, **the compiler only sees it as an `Animal`**.

So:

```java
a.sayBye(); // ‚ùå Error: sayBye() is not in Animal class
```

---

### ‚úÖ Downcasting:

```java
Dog d = (Dog) a; // Safe because 'a' is actually a Dog object
d.sayBye();      // Now the method is accessible
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What If You Downcast Incorrectly?

```java
Animal a = new Animal(); // NOT a Dog
Dog d = (Dog) a;         // ‚ùå Runtime Error
d.sayBye();              // ‚ùå ClassCastException
```

#### ‚ùó Output:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException: class Animal cannot be cast to class Dog
```

---

## üß† Summary

|Case|Compile-Time|Runtime|
|---|---|---|
|`a.sayBye()`|‚ùå Error (method not in reference type)|-|
|`(Dog)a.sayBye()` (when `a` is actually Dog)|‚úÖ|‚úÖ|
|`(Dog)a.sayBye()` (when `a` is NOT Dog)|‚úÖ|‚ùå `ClassCastException`|

## üî∑ Problem Setup: Accessing Child-Specific Methods via Parent Reference

```java
class Animal {
    void speak() {
        System.out.println("Animal speaks");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }

    void sayBye() {
        System.out.println("Dog says bye");
    }
}
```

---

## üî∂ Case 1: Parent Reference to Child Object (No Downcasting)

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog(); // Upcasting

        a.speak();   // ‚úÖ Allowed (inherited from Animal)
        // a.bark(); // ‚ùå Compile-time error: method not in Animal
        // a.sayBye(); // ‚ùå Compile-time error: method not in Animal
    }
}
```

‚úÖ `a.speak()` works because `speak()` is declared in `Animal`.

‚ùå `a.bark()` and `a.sayBye()` don't work, even though the object is a `Dog`. The **reference type is `Animal`**, which **doesn‚Äôt know** about these methods.

---

## üî∂ Case 2: Downcasting to Access Child-Specific Methods

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog(); // Upcasting

        // Downcasting
        Dog d = (Dog) a;

        d.bark();      // ‚úÖ Now works
        d.sayBye();    // ‚úÖ Now works
        d.speak();     // ‚úÖ Also inherited from Animal
    }
}
```

Now that we **cast the object back to Dog**, we can access all Dog-specific methods.

---

## üî∂ Case 3: Downcasting Risk ‚Äì ClassCastException

If you try to downcast **an object that is not actually a Dog**, it will compile but crash at runtime.

```java
Animal a = new Animal(); // Not a Dog

Dog d = (Dog) a; // ‚ùå Compiles, but causes ClassCastException at runtime
d.bark();
```

‚úÖ To avoid this, use `instanceof`:

```java
if (a instanceof Dog) {
    Dog d = (Dog) a;
    d.sayBye();
} else {
    System.out.println("Not a Dog");
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

|Expression|Valid?|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|`Animal a = new Dog();`|‚úÖ|Upcasting ‚Äì Safe|
|`a.speak();`|‚úÖ|Method in parent class|
|`a.sayBye();`|‚ùå|Method in child ‚Äì not visible via parent reference|
|`((Dog)a).sayBye();`|‚úÖ|Downcasting enables child methods|
|`Dog d = (Dog)new Animal();`|‚ùå Runtime Error|ClassCastException|


## üîÅ **Summary**

|Type|Achieved By|Binding Type|Time of Decision|
|---|---|---|---|
|Compile-time Polymorphism|Method Overloading|Static|Compile Time|
|Runtime Polymorphism|Method Overriding|Dynamic|Runtime|

---

### üîö Final Remarks:

- Method Overloading: **Same method name, different parameter lists**
    
- Method Overriding: **Same method name and signature in parent and child class**
    
- **Upcasting** helps achieve runtime polymorphism.
    
- JVM uses **Dynamic Method Dispatch** to resolve overridden methods.
    
- Always remember: the **object** determines the method execution, not the reference type.


---

### ‚úÖ What's Happening in Your Code?

You have:

```java
Animal a = new Animal(); // Parent object
Animal b = new Dog();    // Parent reference, Child object
```

Then you do:

```java
a.move(); // "Animals can move"
b.move(); // "Dogs can walk and run"
System.out.println(b.i); // prints 1 ‚Äî from Animal class!
```

---

## üß† Why does `b.move()` call the **Dog** method, but `b.i` gives **Animal.i**?

This is because of how Java handles:

|Feature|Java uses|
|---|---|
|**Methods**|**Runtime (dynamic) polymorphism** ‚Äî a.k.a. method **overriding**|
|**Variables**|**Compile-time (static) binding** ‚Äî a.k.a. variable **hiding**|

---

### üîÑ Method Overriding (Dynamic Binding)

When you **override a method** (`move()`), Java checks the **actual object type** (`Dog`) at **runtime**, and calls the appropriate method:

```java
b.move(); // Dog's move() runs, because `b` is actually a Dog object
```

---

### üö´ Variable Hiding (Static Binding)

But **instance variables** (`int i = 1` in Animal, and `int i = 0` in Dog) are **not polymorphic**. Java checks the **reference type** at **compile time**.

```java
System.out.println(b.i); // Animal's `i`, because `b` is of type Animal
```

Even though `b` actually points to a `Dog` object, the compiler uses the type of `b` (which is `Animal`) to resolve variables.

---

### ‚úÖ How to access `Dog`'s `i`?

You need to cast it:

```java
System.out.println(((Dog)b).i); // prints 0 ‚Äî now accessing Dog's i
```

---

## üìå Summary:

- **Methods are overridden** ‚Üí Java uses **object type** at **runtime**.
    
- **Variables are hidden** ‚Üí Java uses **reference type** at **compile time**.
    

### However, in the runtime, JVM figures out the object type and would run the method that belongs to that particular object.


### Questions 1
#### class Animal { 
public void move() {
System.out.println("Animals can move");
}
}
class Dog extends Animal { 
public void move() {
System.out.println("Dogs can walk and run");
} 
public void bark() {
System.out.println("Dogs can bark");
}
} 
public class TestDog { 
public static void main(String args[]) { 
Animal a = new Animal(); // Animal reference and object Animal b = new Dog(); // Animal reference but Dog object a.move(); // runs the method in Animal class b.move(); // runs the method in Dog class b.bark(); 
}
}
#### Output

TestDog.java:26: error: cannot find symbol
      b.bark();
       ^
  symbol:   method bark()
  location: variable b of type Animal
1 error

This program will throw a compile time error since b's reference type Animal doesn't have a method by the name of bark.





### üî• Java Dynamic Binding (a.k.a. Late Binding or Runtime Polymorphism)

**Dynamic binding** in Java means that **method calls are resolved at runtime** ‚Äî not at compile time ‚Äî based on the actual object type (not the reference type).

---

### üìò What does this really mean?

Let‚Äôs take a basic example:

```java
class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();  // Reference type is Animal, but object is Dog
        a.sound();             // What happens here?
    }
}
```

#### Output:

```
Dog barks
```

---

### üí° Why does this happen?

Java sees that `a` is declared as type `Animal`, but the actual object is of type `Dog`. So at **runtime**, it dynamically **binds** the `sound()` method to the one in the `Dog` class.

This is called **dynamic method dispatch**, and it's a core feature of **runtime polymorphism**.

---

### üîç When does dynamic binding happen?

- ‚úÖ **Only with instance methods**
    
- ‚ùå **Not with fields (variables)** ‚Äî they are resolved at **compile time**
    
- ‚ùå **Not with static methods** ‚Äî those are resolved using the **reference type**
    
- ‚ùå **Not with private methods** ‚Äî they can't be overridden
    

---

### üëÄ Quick Static vs Dynamic Binding Summary:

| Feature              | Binding Time      | Based On                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Instance methods** | Runtime (dynamic) | Actual object type          |
| **Static methods**   | Compile time      | Reference type              |
| **Fields/Variables** | Compile time      | Reference type              |
| **Private methods**  | Compile time      | Class in which it's defined |
|                      |                   |                             |


Great! Let‚Äôs break down **static binding** (aka **early binding**) in Java with clarity.

---

### üß† **What is Static Binding in Java?**

**Static binding** means that the **method or variable to be called is resolved at compile time** ‚Äî _based on the reference type_, not the actual object.

This is also called **early binding**, because everything is "bound" before your code actually runs.

---

### ‚úÖ When does Static Binding happen?

- **Static methods**
    
- **Private methods**
    
- **Final methods**
    
- **Fields/variables**
    
- **Overloaded methods** (not overridden)
    

---

### üß™ Example:

```java
class Animal {
    static void run() {
        System.out.println("Animal runs");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    static void run() {
        System.out.println("Dog runs");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();  // Reference type is Animal
        a.run();               // Which run() gets called?
    }
}
```

#### Output:

```
Animal runs
```

> Why not `Dog runs`?  
> Because **static methods are bound at compile time**, and the compiler checks the **reference type (`Animal`)**, not the object type (`Dog`).

---

### üìå Important Notes

- Static binding gives **better performance** since it's resolved at compile time.
- static methos can't be overridden
    
- You **cannot override** static, private, or final methods ‚Äî they are **hidden**, not overridden.
    
- That's why dynamic polymorphism (runtime method overriding) only works with **non-static, non-final, non-private instance methods**.
