## üî∑ Executor Framework Concepts (00:11:24 onwards)

### ‚úÖ Thread Reuse via ExecutorService

- If 3 threads are created and there are 9 tasks, each thread may execute 3 tasks.
    
- Threads are reused ‚Äî for example, the same thread may calculate factorial of 1 and then of 4, 5, 6, etc.
    

---

## üî∑ `shutdown()` and `submit()` (00:11:46)

### ‚úÖ `executorService.submit(task)`

- Used to submit tasks for execution.
    

### ‚úÖ `executorService.shutdown()`

- Initiates an **orderly shutdown**.
    
- Previously submitted tasks are executed, but **no new tasks** are accepted.
    
- Submitting tasks **after shutdown** causes:
    
    ```java
    java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException
    ```
    

---

## üî∑ `awaitTermination()` Explained (00:12:44)

### ‚úÖ Why Needed:

- The main thread doesn‚Äôt wait automatically for threads to finish.
    
- Use `awaitTermination()` to wait for all tasks to complete.
    

### ‚úÖ Syntax:

```java
executorService.shutdown();
try {
    if (!executorService.awaitTermination(100, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
        System.out.println("Still waiting...");
    }
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### ‚úÖ Explanation:

- Waits up to 100 seconds for all tasks to complete.
    
- Returns `true` if all tasks completed within time, else `false`.
    

---

## üî∑ Polling-based Wait Loop (00:14:05)

### ‚úÖ Pattern:

```java
executorService.shutdown();
while (!executorService.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
    System.out.println("Waiting...");
}
System.out.println("All tasks completed.");
```

### üîÑ Output:

```
Waiting...
Waiting...
All tasks completed.
```

## üî∑ `Executor` vs `ExecutorService` (00:15:00)

|Feature|Executor|ExecutorService|
|---|---|---|
|Interface method|`execute(Runnable)`|`submit()`, `shutdown()`, `awaitTermination()`, etc.|
|Return value|void|`Future<?>`|
|Shutdown control|‚ùå Not available|‚úÖ Available|
|Advanced features|‚ùå|‚úÖ|

---

## üî∑ Polymorphism in Executors (00:16:15)

You can declare the variable as `Executor`:

```java
Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
```

But:

- You can only access `execute()`, **not** `submit()`, `shutdown()` etc.
    
- Use `ExecutorService` for full control.
    

---

## üî∑ `submit()` vs `execute()` (00:17:09)

### `execute(Runnable task)`:

- Returns `void`
    

### `submit(Callable<T> task)`:

- Returns a `Future<T>` object.
    

---

## üî∑ Example: Using `Future` (00:17:33 - 00:19:01)

### ‚úÖ Code:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
            return 42;
        });

        System.out.println("Result: " + future.get());

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### üîÑ Output:

```
Result: 42
```

---

## üî∑ `Future` methods (00:19:31)

### ‚úÖ `future.get()`:

- Waits if necessary and retrieves result.
    

### ‚úÖ `future.isDone()`:

- Returns `true` if task completed (normal or via exception/cancelled).
    

---

## üî∑ Wildcards with Future (00:20:22)

### ‚úÖ Generic Future:

```java
Future<?> future = executor.submit(() -> "Hello");
System.out.println(future.get());  // prints: Hello
```

- Use `?` when type isn't known or return value varies.
    
- Can be helpful when you're focusing on task completion more than the return type.
    

---

## ‚ùó Code Glitch Observed (00:20:51)

- If trying to treat a lambda returning a value (`Callable`) as a `Runnable`, you will get a compilation error:
    

```java
Runnable r = () -> "Hello"; // ‚ùå Error: incompatible types
```

### ‚úÖ Fix:

```java
Callable<String> task = () -> "Hello"; // ‚úÖ Correct
```

### Executor Framework in Java

1. **ExecutorService**:
   - Provides a high-level API for managing thread pools and executing asynchronous tasks.
   - Allows submission of tasks for execution and manages the lifecycle of threads.

2. **Task Submission**:
   - Tasks can be submitted using the `submit` method, which returns a `Future` object.
   - The `Future` object can be used to retrieve the result of the task once it is completed.

3. **Shutdown Procedures**:
   - `shutdown()`: Initiates an orderly shutdown where previously submitted tasks are executed, but no new tasks are accepted.
   - `shutdownNow()`: Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks immediately and shuts down the executor.
   - `awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`: Blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown request, or the timeout occurs, or the current thread is interrupted.

### Example Code

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class ExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Submit tasks
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            final int taskNumber = i;
            executorService.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskNumber + " is being processed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                // Simulate task processing
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            });
        }

        // Shutdown the executor
        executorService.shutdown();
        try {
            // Wait for all tasks to complete
            if (!executorService.awaitTermination(100, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                executorService.shutdownNow(); // Force shutdown if tasks are not completed
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            executorService.shutdownNow();
        }

        System.out.println("All tasks completed.");
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Creating ExecutorService**:
   - `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3)`: Creates a thread pool with 3 threads.

2. **Submitting Tasks**:
   - A loop submits 9 tasks to the executor service. Each task prints a message and simulates processing by sleeping for 1 second.

3. **Shutdown Procedure**:
   - `executorService.shutdown()`: Initiates an orderly shutdown.
   - `executorService.awaitTermination(100, TimeUnit.SECONDS)`: Waits for all tasks to complete within 100 seconds. If tasks are not completed, `shutdownNow()` is called to force shutdown.

### Key Points

- **ExecutorService**: Manages a pool of threads and executes submitted tasks.
- **Task Submission**: Use `submit` to submit tasks and get a `Future` object.
- **Shutdown**: Use `shutdown` for orderly shutdown and `shutdownNow` for immediate shutdown.
- **awaitTermination**: Blocks until all tasks are completed or the timeout occurs.
- **Future Object**: Represents the result of an asynchronous computation. Use `get` to retrieve the result, which blocks until the task is complete.

### Handling Results with Future

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class FutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
            // Simulate a task that returns a result
            return 42;
        };

        Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(task);

        try {
            Integer result = future.get(); // Blocks until the task is complete
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executorService.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Callable Task**:
   - A `Callable` task that returns an integer value (42).

2. **Submitting the Task**:
   - `executorService.submit(task)`: Submits the task and returns a `Future<Integer>`.

3. **Retrieving the Result**:
   - `future.get()`: Blocks until the task is complete and retrieves the result.

### Summary

- **Executor Framework**: Provides a high-level API for managing thread pools and executing asynchronous tasks.
- **Task Submission**: Use `submit` to submit tasks and get a `Future` object.
- **Shutdown Procedures**: Use `shutdown` for orderly shutdown and `shutdownNow` for immediate shutdown.
- **Future Object**: Represents the result of an asynchronous computation. Use `get` to retrieve the result.
