## 🧵 Thread Safety in Java – Notes

---

### ❓ What is Thread Safety?

**Thread safety** means:

- When **multiple threads** access a shared resource **simultaneously**, the **outcome remains consistent** and there are **no unexpected results**, like:
    
    - Race conditions
        
    - Data corruption
        
    - Inconsistent state
        

> ✅ If multiple threads can use an object or a block of code **without breaking things or causing bugs**, it's called **thread-safe**.

### 🔥 Why is Thread Safety Important?

Without thread safety:

- Code can behave **unpredictably**.
    
- Results may vary each time due to **timing issues**.
    
- Bugs like **lost updates, dirty reads**, or **incorrect calculations** can occur.

### 🧰 How to Achieve Thread Safety in Java?

Some key techniques and tools:

|Technique|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`synchronized` keyword|Ensures only one thread can access a block/method at a time|
|`wait()` and `notify()`|Helps threads communicate and wait/notify based on resource availability|
|`ReentrantLock`|More advanced locking mechanism from `java.util.concurrent.locks`|
|`ReadWriteLock`|Allows multiple readers or one writer thread at a time|
|Thread-safe data structures|Like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `Vector`, etc.|

> All of these help **prevent race conditions** and ensure **thread coordination**.

### 🧵 Examples That Will Be Discussed:

- `String` → ✅ **Immutable** and thread-safe.
    
- `StringBuilder` → ❌ Not thread-safe.
    
- `StringBuffer` → ✅ Thread-safe (uses `synchronized` methods).
    

These examples help visualize **real-world cases** of thread safety.

### 🔄 Summary

- **Thread-safe** = No data corruption or race condition, even with **concurrent access**.
    
- All synchronization techniques you’ve learned (like `synchronized`, `wait/notify`, `locks`) aim to **make code thread-safe**.
    
- As you go deeper, you'll be able to **recognize** which Java classes are thread-safe and **choose the right one** for your needs.
